# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks and Visualizations in R

## Overview

This repository contains R code for conducting various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and generating visualizations to gain insights from textual data. The script covers a wide range of NLP techniques, including dependency parsing, lexical dispersion analysis, wordscores modeling, Wordfish modeling, and Correspondence Analysis. It leverages popular R libraries such as `udpipe`, `ggraph`, `quanteda`, and more to perform these tasks efficiently.

## NLP Tasks Covered

1. **Dependency Parsing**: Analyze the syntactic structure of sentences and visualize the dependency relationships between words.
2. **Lexical Dispersion Analysis**: Explore the distribution and occurrence patterns of specific words across a text corpus.
3. **Wordscores Modeling**: Estimate word positions and predict document positions based on reference scores.
4. **Wordfish Modeling**: Apply a probabilistic semantic scaling technique to estimate word positions and analyze semantic structures.
5. **Correspondence Analysis**: Conduct a multivariate statistical technique to explore relationships between categorical variables and visualizing them in a low-dimensional space.

## Requirements

To run the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- R (
- Required R packages: `udpipe`, `rvest`, `readtext`, `quanteda.textmodels`, `quanteda.textplots`, `ggraph`, `stringr`

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the R script `nlp_tasks_visualizations.R` in your R environment.
3. Ensure all required R packages are installed by running `install.packages()` if necessary.
4. Run the script to perform various NLP tasks and generate visualizations.
5. Explore the generated visualizations and analyze the insights gained from the text data.

## File Structure

- `nlp_tasks_visualizations.R`: R script containing the code for performing NLP tasks and generating visualizations.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.

## Results

The analysis provides comprehensive insights into the structure, semantics, and patterns within textual data. By leveraging advanced NLP techniques and visualizations, users can better understand and interpret the underlying information in text corpora.
